Be in the main branch or whatever branch contains the source docs folder:

    mike deploy --deploy-prefix docs --branch "docsite" --push v4 latest

`--push` is optional. If you want to self-host the versioned docs, leave it out and run:

    mike serve -b "docsite"

Add `-a IP:PORT` to bind to specific ip and port instead of localhost:8000

!!! note
    CairoSVG and Pillow are specifically for [social card support][1] and kind of
    a pain to deal with because Cairo requires external GTK libraries which are
    hard to come by on Windows. The Cairo docs point to resources that no longer
    exist and GTK runtime libs are usually just embedded with the apps that use
    them.

    The easy but janky solution I found was to install this UniConverter[2] app
    and then add `%ProgramFiles%\UniConvertor-2.0rc5\dlls` to PATH.

    I also originally had an issue with the `defusedxml` python dependency which
    was stuck on 0.5.0 for some reason and I needed to manually upgrade it to 0.7.1
