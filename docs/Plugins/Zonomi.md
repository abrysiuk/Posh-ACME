# How To Use the Zonomi DNS Plugin

This plugin works against the [Zonomi DNS](https://zonomi.com) provider. It is assumed that you have already setup an account and created the DNS zone(s) you will be working against.

!!! note
    The API Zonomi uses is also used by other providers such as [RimuHosting](https://rimuhosting.com/). This plugin is compatible with those as well.

## Setup

Generate an API key from the [API Keys](https://zonomi.com/app/cp/apikeys.jsp) page using the "DNS" type. Click the the green plus icon to generate a new key if one is not already displayed.

If you use a different compatible provider, there should be an equivalent control panel page for API Keys available.

## Using the Plugin

The API key is used with the `ZonomiKey` SecureString parameter. Users on other Zonomi compatible providers will also need to supply the API URL for that provider to the `ZonomiApiUrl` parameter.

!!! warning
    The `ZonomiApiKey` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in the next major module version. If you are using it, please migrate to the Secure parameter set.
